# Black Jack Card Game (Python)

A text based implementation of the classic “Black Jack” game, written in Python. This project was built to practice object-oriented design, multi-file modularity, and game loop logic.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Black Jack is a popular card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it. Players can “hit” (take another card) or “stand” (keep current hand), with special rules for dealer play, betting chips, and handling busts.

## 🧩 What This Project Covers

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Card, Deck, Hand, Player, Chips classes.
- **Multi-File Structure:** Organized code with separate modules for clarity (e.g., card.py, deck.py, chips.py, utils.py, main.py).
- **Command-Line Interaction:** Playable through terminal input/output.
- **Game Logic:** Handles shuffling, dealing, hitting, standing, busts, dealer play, betting, and replaying.
- **Pythonic State Control:** Proper use of return values and function arguments to manage game flow.

## 🗂️ File Structure

- `main.py` – Main game loop
- `card.py` – Card class
- `deck.py` – Deck class
- `hand.py` – Hand class
- `chips.py` – Betting system class
- `constants.py` – Global constants
- `utils.py` – Helper functions

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone/download this repo.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:
  python main.py
4. Follow on-screen prompts to play and bet chips.

## ✏️ What I Practiced

- Modular design with multiple files and imports.
- Managing game state and logic cleanly.
- Implementing betting and handling edge cases (ace values, busts, repeats).
